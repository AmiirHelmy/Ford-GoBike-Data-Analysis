## Key Insights

- COVID-19 affected the bike rides.
- Rush hours are (8 AM, 9 AM, 5 PM and 6 PM) which are starting/leaving work hours.
- Providing offers to and from crowded stations and at rush hours can attract users.
- Customers have more trip durations than subscribers, we can offer them subscription plans or bundles.

## Summary Of Findings:

- Most users prefer electric bike.
- Rush hours are (8 AM, 9 AM, 5 PM and 6 PM) which are working hours, providing offers from/to crowded stations at these times can attract users.
- COVID-19 has caused the bike rides to drop by 127,993 in 2020 rides, the least number of rides was through the lockdown period (March:April 2020).
- The app is the preferred access method for both Subscribers & Customers, we might consider sending offers through the app.
